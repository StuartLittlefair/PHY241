    "\n",
    "What about reddening and extinction? Just like extinction by dust in our own atmosphere, interstellar extinction will make the stars fainter, and redder. So, whilst a finite distance moves an star vertically in the CMD, dust along the line of sight will move a star down and to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write that the total extinction in the $V$-band, in magnitudes, is $A_V$. This means that if the true magnitude of a star is $V_0$, the observed magnitude is $V = V_0 + A_V$. However, the dust also makes the star redder, so we can write that the true colour of the star is related to the observed colour is $(B-V) = (B-V)_0 + E(B-V)$. The quantity $E(B-V)$ is known as the colour excess, or reddening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both $A_V$ and $E(B-V)$ are related to the amount of dust between us and the cluster, it should not surprise you that they are related. It turns out that $A_V = 3.1 E(B-V)$; see [Shultz & Wiemer (1975)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975A%26A....43..133S/abstract), for example."
