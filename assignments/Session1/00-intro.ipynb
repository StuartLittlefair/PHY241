    "A series of lectures cannot teach you to write code. You would not expect to listen to 10 lectures on the violin, and then pick one up and be able to play. Writing code, like playing music, is a skill that must be learnt through *practice*. In each lecture, I will provide a basic introduction, and then present a series of tasks to get you practicing writing code. At the end of each lecture is an assessed piece of homework. The goal is to get you to write as much code as possible, and hope you learn as you go. \n",

The [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) is a large collection of modules that provides cross-platform implementations of common facilities such as access to the operating system, file I/O, string management, network communication, and much more. In addition, there are many essential third-party libraries which help with more complex and specialised jobs such as analysing and plotting data. Each lecture/practical will focus on a specific library and task.\n",

However, it is **really** important that you don't just copy-and-paste code without understanding how it works.
