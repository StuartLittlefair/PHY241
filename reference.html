<dl>
<dt><span id="argument">argument</span></dt>
<dd>A value given to a function or program when it runs. The term is often used interchangeably (and inconsistently) with <a href="#parameter">parameter</a>.
</dd>
<dt><span id="assertion">assertion</span></dt>
<dd>An expression which is supposed to be true at a particular point in a program. Programmers typically put assertions in their code to check for errors; if the assertion fails (i.e., if the expression evaluates as false), the program halts and produces an error message. See also: <a href="#invariant">invariant</a>, <a href="#precondition">precondition</a>, <a href="#postcondition">postcondition</a>.
</dd>
<dt><span id="assign">assign</span></dt>
<dd>To give a value a name by associating a variable with it.
</dd>
<dt><span id="body">body</span></dt>
<dd>(of a function): the statements that are executed when a function runs.
</dd>
<dt><span id="broadcast">broadcast</span></dt>
<dd>The term broadcasting describes how numpy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations. Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is &quot;broadcast&quot; across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes.
</dd>
<dt><span id="call-stack">call stack</span></dt>
<dd>A data structure inside a running program that keeps track of active function calls.
</dd>
<dt><span id="case-insensitive">case-insensitive</span></dt>

</dd>
<dt><span id="comment">comment</span></dt>
<dd>A remark in a program that is intended to help human readers understand what is going on, but is ignored by the computer. Comments in Python, R, and the Unix shell start with a <code>#</code> character and run to the end of the line; comments in SQL start with <code>--</code>, and other languages have other conventions.

<dd>To apply one function to the result of another, such as <code>f(g(x))</code>.
