PHY241 - Observational Astronomy
========================================================

Here are found Jupyter notebooks to assist with my 
Observational Astronomy course for undergraduate astronomy 
students at the University of Sheffield. 

These notebooks can be viewed statically online  [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/StuartLittlefair/PHY241/tree/master).

Alternatively, if you would like to download and run the notebooks
interactively, you can do that. They are intended to be executed
with Jupyter 4 or newer. You can find installation instructions
[here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html).

The notebooks and associated data for all my courses can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/StuartLittlefair/PHY241/zipball/master).
Unzip the notebooks:

```
unzip PHY241.zip
```

and start the IPython notebook in the resulting directory.

```
jupyter notebook
```
